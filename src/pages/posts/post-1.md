# My path from now on

Inspired by many people on "X", I have decided to document at least a little bit of my path from now on. I think it's good for the mind and for setting goals to write things down. I don't know if it will work, but it's all about taking steps.

## What the hell happened

Since I got to know the programming world back in 2017, I've only had two peaks of motivation:

- When I started
- Now

At first, when you start learning something, you always feel motivated (at least I do). But then, when you go in-depth, you lose that motivation and let it go.

My path in programming can be summarized as follows:

1. Study a degree
2. Enter to work in a big company
3. Pandemic
4. Getting demotivated and leaving the job
5. Depression

## The Recent Years

For the last three and a half years since I quit my job, I have been:

- Procrastinating
- Reading a lot (a positive thing)
- Consuming a lot of visual media

I needed motivation to get back to programming, or so I said, because they are just excuses.

I think the best thing that has happened to me recently is to have no motivation beyond the one I had in the beginning: **learning**. This has brought me to the point where I am now:

- I want to build things
- Learn the backend side
- Have a routine of about 14 hours a day of work
- In short, be a better programmer because I have never taken this seriously

You may think that's a lot of hours and that I'll end up burnt out, but this is what I really want.I think being so focused and having such a routine will make me a better person outside of this field as well. I hope I'm not so sick in the head that nobody understands me.

I will improve my writing too. Bye.
