inspired by many people on "x", i have decided to document at least a little bit of my path from now on. i think it's good for the mind and for setting goals to write things down. i don't know if it will work, but it's all about taking steps.

## WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED

since i got to know the programming world back in 2017, i've only had two peaks of motivation:

- when i started
- now

at first, when you start learning something, you always feel motivated (at least i do) but then, when you go in-depth, you lose that motivation and let it go.

my path in programming can be summarized as follows:

1. study a degree
2. join a big corp
3. pandemic
4. getting demotivated and quitting the job
5. depression

## RECENT TIMES

i have been:

- procrastinating
- reading a lot (a positive thing)
- consuming a lot of visual media (classic movies and documentaries that brought me wisdom)
- start projects, stop coding, return to another project

i needed motivation to get back to programming, or so i said, because they are just excuses.

# MY PATH FROM NOW ON

i think the best thing that has happened to me recently is to have no motivation beyond the one i had in the beginning <span style="color: #DBC587;">(**learning**)</span>. this has brought me to the moment where i am now:

- i want to build cool stuff
- learn the backend side (before I only did frontent, I felt very limited)
- have a routine of about 12 hours a day of work
- make connections with people who are interesting and inspire me

you may think that's a lot of hours and that i'll end up burnt out, but this is what i really want.I think being so focused and having such a routine will make me a better person outside of this field as well.
