inspired by many people on x, i have decided to document at least a little bit of my path from now on. i think it's good for the mind and for setting goals to write things down. i don't know if it will work, but it's all about taking steps.

## WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED

since i got to know the programming world back in 2017, i've only had two peaks of motivation:

- when i started
- now

at first, when you start learning something, you always feel motivated (at least i do) but then, when you go in-depth, you lose that motivation and let it go.

my path in programming can be summarized as follows:

1. study a degree
2. join a big corp
3. pandemic (agoraphobia after this hit me hard and still doing it)
4. getting demotivated and quitting the job
5. depression

## RECENT TIMES

i have been:

- reading a lot (positive acquired habit)
- consuming a lot of visual media (classic movies, anime and documentaries that brought me wisdom)
- start a project, put it aside, stop programming for a while and start the wheel again

i needed motivation to get back to programming, or so i said, because they are just excuses. everything was to tell myself that tomorrow or next week i will be productive again, spoiler, never happened.

# MY PATH FROM NOW ON

i think the best thing that has happened to me recently is to have no motivation beyond the one i had in the beginning <span style="color: #DBC587;">(**learning**)</span> this has brought me to the moment where i am now:

- i want to build cool stuff
- learn the backend side (before i only did frontent, i felt very limited)
- have a routine of 12-14 hours of work a day, being focus
- i will use the weekends to learn in a more academic way, same hours
- make connections with people who are interesting and inspire me

you may think that's a lot of hours and that i'll end up burnt out, but this is what i really want.i think being so focused and having such a routine will make me a better person outside of this field as well.

to end with this that nobody is interested in, i have established a routine of daily physical workout and a kind of ritual before starting the day: watch one episode of one piece a day until i finish it, ok i am not crazy at all.
